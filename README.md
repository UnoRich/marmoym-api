# Marmoym API
Marmoym API is a server side application that processes API requests of different types of Marmoym Clients. 

## How we build our world
Think of pieces of information interspersed randomly. Could there be any underlying connections inbetween the ones? _Ontological_ view of a world helps us thank and truly enjoy our being. A great number of things, we used to dismiss in our life, bear resemblance and ties to one another with sometimes unexplicable manners. 

**Marmoym**, which touts itself to become a platform to build the dictionary by receiving submits from users, is not a mere dictionary. It rather aspires to be an intricate web of various concepts with ingeniously devised representational tools. Discussions on how we structure the pile of information is ongoing and we are open to your thoughts.

## Development
Though the tastes differ by individual engineers, the basic guideline we put forward is to use at least two different node.js instances when developing the application. One for repetitively restarting the application (server) everytime a change has happend in the files, and the other for constantly recompiling (TypeScript compiler) the source code.

Following command to restart the appilication.
```
npm start
```

For watch to compile,
```
npm run dev
```

You can use `npm` or `yarn`.

## Contributing
We are more than welcome to your participation or any type of contributing. There is a guideline, though, which should not intimidate any. Please refer to it before you decide to do something for us.
